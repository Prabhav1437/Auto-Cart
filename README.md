Auto Cart is a smart shopping cart system designed to automate the billing process in supermarkets using **RFID technology**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Python**. It eliminates manual scanning and long queues by automatically reading product information and generating the bill in real time.

## 📦 Features

- 📡 **RFID-based Product Scanning** – Instantly scans RFID tags attached to items.
- 💻 **Raspberry Pi & Arduino Integration** – Arduino Collects the data through RFID and raspberry pi interprets the data and shows the bill through software.
- 🧾 **Automatic Bill Generation** – Creates and displays the bill once the billing RFID is scanned.
- 🖥️ **Interactive GUI using Tkinter** – Shows product name, price, and total.
- 💰 **Multiple Payment Options** – Supports **Cash** and **UPI** payments (QR Code shown).
- 🙏 **Thank You Screen** – Displays a final message after successful payment.
- 🔄 **Restart Option** – Clears cart and restarts the session for the next user.

## 🧰 How It Works

1. Products with RFID tags are placed into the cart.
2. RFID reader (connected to Arduino) scans and displays product on the oled.
3. Python GUI receives data and displays item name and price.
4. When **Checkout button is clicked** the bill is generated.
5. The customer selects **Cash** or **UPI** payment.
6. If UPI is selected, a QR code is displayed for 100 seconds.
7. After payment, a thank-you message is shown and the system resets.
